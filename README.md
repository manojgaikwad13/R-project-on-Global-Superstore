## Overview 
This R project aims to analyze the Global Superstore dataset to gain insights into sales trends, customer behavior, and geographical patterns. The dataset contains information about orders, customers, products, and sales across multiple regions and categories.
Purpose: 
This section briefly explains why the project exists and what problem it aims to solve. In the case of the Global Superstore Data Analysis Project, the purpose could be to extract meaningful insights from the Global Superstore dataset to inform business decisions, improve sales strategies, or optimize operations.

### For example:

Analyze sales trends over time to identify seasonal patterns.
Segment customers based on purchasing behavior to target marketing efforts effectively.
Determine the most profitable product categories and regions.
Forecast future sales to aid in inventory management and resource planning.
Scope: This defines the boundaries of the project, indicating what will and will not be covered. It helps manage expectations and provides clarity on what stakeholders can expect from the analysis. 

### For instance:

The analysis will focus on historical sales data from the Global Superstore dataset.
Customer demographic data may be included for segmentation analysis.
The project will not delve into external factors influencing sales, such as economic indicators or competitor analysis.
